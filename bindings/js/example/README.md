# Usage
First build the depthai javascript bindings to get the `depthai-js.js` and `depthai-js.wasm` file (see the [bindings/js folder](../)).  
Then run the example using `./run.sh` and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.  
  
To generate a different `public/img_frame.dump` file you can use `serialize.cpp` from this folder.
