     *   without user intervention. Image loading, recalibration, quality checking,

     *   fixed (e.g., factory setups, static rigs). Enables stricter checks
     *   to ensure calibration stability over time.
     *
     * - OPTIMIZE_SPEED (2):
     *   Prioritizes calibration speed over accuracy. Suitable when quick
     *   recalibration is needed, or when calibration must run frequently
     *   with limited compute resources.
     *
     * - OPTIMIZE_PERFORMANCE (3):
     *   Prioritizes calibration accuracy and robustness, even at the cost
     *   of additional compute time. Suitable for high-precision use cases
     *   where depth quality is critical.
     *
     * - SKIP_CHECKS (4):
     *   Skips validation and quality checks entirely. Intended for advanced
     *   use cases, debugging, or when external systems handle quality
     *   assurance. Use with caution.
