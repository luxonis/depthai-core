     * The basic cost function used by the Stereo Accelerator for matching the left and right images is the Census
     * Transform. It works on a block of pixels and computes a bit vector which represents the structure of the
     * image in that block.
     * There are two types of Census Transform based on how the middle pixel is used:
     * Classic Approach and Modified Census. The comparisons that are made between pixels can be or not thresholded.
     * In some cases a mask can be applied to filter out only specific bits from the entire bit stream.
     * All these approaches are:
     * Classic Approach: Uses middle pixel to compare against all its neighbors over a defined window. Each
     * comparison results in a new bit, that is 0 if central pixel is smaller, or 1 if is it bigger than its neighbor.
     * Modified Census Transform: same as classic Census Transform, but instead of comparing central pixel
     * with its neighbors, the window mean will be compared with each pixel over the window.
     * Thresholding Census Transform: same as classic Census Transform, but it is not enough that a
     * neighbor pixel to be bigger than the central pixel, it must be significant bigger (based on a threshold).
     * Census Transform with Mask: same as classic Census Transform, but in this case not all of the pixel from
     * the support window are part of the binary descriptor. We use a ma sk “M” to define which pixels are part
     * of the binary descriptor (1), and which pixels should be skipped (0).
